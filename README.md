# üöÄ Cursor for Product Managers ü§ñ

Welcome to **Cursor for Product Managers**! This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit and framework designed to supercharge your product management workflow using Cursor as an AI-native PM copilot. Originally inspired by the [Maven course on AI-native PMs](https://maven.com/p/0a96cb/cursor-isn-t-just-for-coding-how-ai-native-p-ms-work), the [AI Dev Tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/tree/main) structured workflow approach, and [Lee Robinson's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QN23ZThdRY), this toolkit transforms Cursor from a coding tool into a powerful product thinking, strategic decision-making, and document creation platform.

Stop wrestling with fragmented product management tools and start building a unified, AI-powered PM workspace that grows smarter with every conversation!

## ‚ú® The Core Idea

Product management involves complex workflows across research, discovery, and delivery. This toolkit aims to bring structure, clarity, and AI-native efficiency to the process by:

1. **Unified Context Management**: Centralizing all PM knowledge, frameworks, and insights in one AI-accessible workspace
2. **Structured Discovery**: Leveraging proven frameworks like Continuous Discovery Habits for systematic user research
3. **AI-Native Workflows**: Using Cursor's capabilities for document-centric work, selective context, and visual diffs
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Building documents that grow smarter with every AI interaction

This approach helps ensure your AI copilot stays on track, makes it easier to manage complex product initiatives, and gives you confidence in AI-generated strategic content.

> Tip: When referencing files in Cursor, use the exact path names above.

## üß≠ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository to your local workspace
2. In Cursor, use `@` to mention files (e.g., `@company-level-context/product-vision-and-strateggy/product-strategy-review.mdc`)
3. Start with strategic review frameworks:
   - **Strategy Review**: `@company-level-context/product-vision-and-strateggy/product-strategy-review.mdc`
   - **Vision Evaluation**: `@company-level-context/product-vision-and-strateggy/product-vision-review.mdc`
   - **OKR Coaching**: `@company-level-context/okrs/okr-sparring-partner.mdc`
4. Or begin with product development: `guides/product/create-prd.mdc` or `initiatives/_templates/setup-new-initiative.mdc`

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Your AI-Native PM Workspace

First, ensure you have Cursor installed and these framework files accessible:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local workspace
2. In Cursor's Agent chat, reference files with `@` (e.g., `@frameworks/continuous-discovery-habits/create-interview-snapshots.mdc`)
3. Follow the structured workflows for different PM activities

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Leverage AI Dev Tasks Framework

This toolkit integrates with the [AI Dev Tasks](https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks/tree/main) structured workflow for complex product initiatives:

1. **Create PRDs**: Use AI to generate comprehensive Product Requirement Documents
2. **Break Down Tasks**: Decompose PRDs into actionable, granular task lists
3. **Iterative Implementation**: Guide AI through one task at a time with verification checkpoints
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual representation of completed tasks and next steps

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Document-Centric Workflow

Instead of chat-based interactions, work directly in documents that grow smarter:

- **Selective Context**: Provide only necessary information to AI for focused assistance
- **Visual Diffs**: Clearly see AI-generated content changes and modifications
- **Continuous Learning**: Documents improve with every AI interaction and iteration

## üîÑ Common Workflows

- **Generate and Process Tasks**: Use `guides/product/generate-tasks.mdc` and `guides/product/process-task-list.mdc`
- **Run Continuous Discovery**: Follow `frameworks/continuous-discovery-habits/*`
- **Score Ideas (ICE)**: Use `frameworks/evidence-guided/calculate-ice-score.mdc`
- **Review Product Strategy**: Use `company-level-context/product-vision-and-strateggy/product-strategy-review.mdc` with PRISM framework
- **Evaluate Product Vision**: Use `company-level-context/product-vision-and-strateggy/product-vision-review.mdc` with 4-criteria scoring
- **Coach OKRs**: Use `company-level-context/okrs/okr-sparring-partner.mdc` for context-aware OKR development
- **Design Team Structure**: Reference `company-level-context/team-structure/readme.md` for organizational models
