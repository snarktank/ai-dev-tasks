# Rule: Identify and Test Assumptions (Continuous Discovery Habits)

## Goal
To extract explicit assumptions from insights and opportunities, categorize and prioritize them to identify "leap-of-faith" assumptions, and design a lightweight, iteratively-scaled testing plan that reduces risk across desirability, usability, feasibility, viability, and ethical dimensions.

---

## When to Use
- After creating opportunities using [Create Opportunities](./create-opportunities.mdc)
- After synthesizing interviews using [Synthesize Interview Snapshots](./synthesize-interview-snapshots.mdc)
- When preparing to generate or downselect solutions with [Generate Solutions](./generate-solutions.mdc)
- Whenever a new idea is proposed and you need to surface and derisk its underlying assumptions

---

## Input
- **Primary Sources:**
  - Prioritized opportunities from `opportunities/`
  - Early solution sketches from `solutions/`
  - Interview snapshots from `user-interviews/snapshots/`
  - Synthesis documents from `user-interviews/synthesis/`
- **Optional Sources:**
  - Product analytics or behavioral data
- **Minimum Requirements:**
  - 1 target opportunity with supporting evidence, and
  - 2–3 candidate solution ideas OR a single idea with key user journeys

---

## Output
**Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
**Location:** `assumptions/`
**Filename:** `assumptions-[opportunity-name]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## AI Instructions for Assumption Identification

### When Receiving Research and Opportunity Data
- **Validate Inputs:** Confirm target opportunity, evidence strength, and affected segments.
- **Clarify Scope:** Define which ideas/journeys will be story-mapped.
- **Note Constraints:** Technical, legal, GTM, success metrics, time/resource limits.

### Assumption Generation Guidelines
- **Use Five Categories:** Desirability, Usability, Feasibility, Viability, Ethical.
- **Phrase Positively and Specifically:** State what must be true, in concrete, testable language.
- **Tie to Behavior:** Prefer assumptions about what users will do over what they say.
- **Attach Evidence:** Link each assumption to quotes, behaviors, or data when available.
- **Normalize Granularity:** Split vague, compound assumptions into specific, testable statements.

### Prioritization Guidelines (Assumption Mapping)
- Place each assumption on a 2D grid:
  - X-axis: Evidence known (left = strong evidence, right = weak evidence)
  - Y-axis: Importance to idea success (low → high)
- **Leap of Faith (LoFA):** Start with the top-right most 2–3 assumptions.

### Testing Guidelines
- **Simulate an Experience, Evaluate Behavior:** Design minimal simulations that let users behave in line with or against the assumption.
- **Define Success Upfront:** Use numbers (e.g., “≥ 3 of 10 participants choose X”), not percentages.
- **Recruit the Right Audience:** Screen by target opportunity and segment; select for variation.
- **Start Small, Then Scale:** Begin with quick signals; escalate to larger tests only if warranted.
- **Triangulate:** Combine small, different methods to reduce false positives/negatives.

## Process

### 1) Prepare Context and Actors
1. Confirm target opportunity and desired outcome(s).
2. Identify key actors (end-user types, internal systems, third parties).

### 2) Story Map Candidate Ideas (or Key Journeys)
1. Assume the solution exists; map what users do to get value.
2. Sequence steps by actor; highlight moments critical to success.

### 3) Generate Assumptions (Five Categories)
For each pivotal step, enumerate assumptions across: Desirability, Usability, Feasibility, Viability, Ethical.

### 4) Pre-Mortem (Prospective Hindsight)
“It’s six months later; launch failed. What went wrong?” Convert reasons into specific assumptions that must be true.

### 5) Walk OST Lines (Outcome ↔ Opportunity ↔ Solution)
Write why the solution addresses the opportunity and drives the outcome. Extract each inference as a testable assumption (esp. viability).

### 6) Normalize, Deduplicate, and Attach Evidence
Rewrite assumptions to be positive, specific, and single-concept. Link supporting quotes, behaviors, analytics.

### 7) Map and Prioritize (Assumption Mapping)
Place assumptions on the grid; mark top-right-most as LoFA.

### 8) Define Test Cards for LoFA Assumptions
For each LoFA, design the smallest simulation with clear success criteria, sample size, method, audience, and time window.

### 9) Run Tests → Record Results → Update the Map
Move assumptions leftward as evidence grows; iterate simulation quality or move to next riskiest item.

### 10) Decide and Proceed
Use accumulated evidence to: evolve the idea, change the opportunity focus, or scale the solution test.

## Assumption Log
| ID | Category | Assumption (positive, specific) | Evidence (link/quote/data) | Importance | Evidence Known | LoFA |
|----|----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|----------------|------|
| A-01 | Desirability | [What must be true] | [Quote/analytics/ref] | High/Med/Low | Weak/Some/Strong | Yes/No |

## Assumption Map (Summary)
- Top-right (LoFA): [A-01, A-07, A-12]
- Notable clusters: [e.g., viability assumptions lacking data]

---

## Test Cards (LoFA)

### Test Card: [A-01] — [Short name]
- **Hypothesis (Assumption):** [Assumption statement]
- **Simulation:** [Prototype/mock experience/data query/concept test]
- **Method:** [Unmoderated test | 1-question survey | Data-mining | Concierge | Email smoke-screen]
- **Audience:** [Screening criteria; segment]
- **Sample Size & Window:** [e.g., n=10 over 2 days]
- **Success Criteria:** [e.g., ≥ 3/10 do X]
- **Risks & Biases:** [Key concerns and mitigations]
- **Next Step if Pass/Fail:** [Scale test / iterate assumption / pivot idea]

*(Repeat per LoFA assumption)*

## Results and Decisions
- **Outcomes:** [Observed behaviors vs. criteria]

- **Decisions:** [Proceed/iterate/stop; changes to opportunity or idea]

## Next Steps
- [ ] Run next LoFA test
- [ ] Evolve idea based on findings
- [ ] Share summary with stakeholders
```

## Templates

### Assumption Statement Pattern
- Actor + Action + Context + Outcome expected  
Example: “Prospective subscribers will select a live game from our home screen when browsing evening entertainment options.”

### Pre-Mortem Prompt
- “It’s six months after launch and this failed. What happened?”  
Capture each reason → rewrite as a positive, specific assumption that must be true.

### Story Map (Quick)
```
Actors: [User, Platform, Partner]
1) [User] does …
2) [Platform] shows …
3) [Partner] provides …
```

### Success Criteria Pattern
- Define n participants and success threshold as an absolute number (not %).  
Example: “≥ 4 of 10 choose sports content on the prototype home screen.”

---

## Quality Indicators

### Strong
- **Specific & Positive:** Testable statements tied to concrete behavior.
- **Evidence-Linked:** Quotes, analytics, or prior tests attached.
- **Right LoFA:** Top-right-most items selected to start.
- **Clear Criteria:** Absolute numbers, audience defined, timeboxed.
- **Iterative Cadence:** Start small; scale only with positive signals.

### Weak
- **Vague:** Generic or compound statements.
- **Opinion-Based:** Future-intent questions; no behavior.
- **Ambiguous Criteria:** Percentages, no audience, no time window.
- **Over-Building:** Large experiments before early signals.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns and Guardrails
- Not generating enough assumptions → Use story map + pre-mortem + OST lines.
- Negative phrasing → Rewrite as what must be true (positive).
- Not specific enough → Add actor, context, behavior, and outcome.
- Favoring one category → Cover all five: Desirability/Usability/Feasibility/Viability/Ethical.
- Overly complex simulations → Design smallest viable simulation first.
- Using percentages for criteria → Use absolute counts (e.g., 3 of 10).
- Missing evaluation details → Define audience, n, window, and behavior.
- Testing with wrong audience → Screen for the target opportunity.
- Designing for less than best-case → Start where passing is most likely; increase difficulty later.

---

## Error Handling
- **Insufficient Data:** Request more snapshots/synthesis; reduce scope.
- **Weak Evidence:** Mark evidence as “Weak” and prioritize accordingly.
- **Conflicting Results:** Triangulate with another small method before decisions.
- **Ethical Concerns:** Document potential harms; design mitigation and/or halt.
