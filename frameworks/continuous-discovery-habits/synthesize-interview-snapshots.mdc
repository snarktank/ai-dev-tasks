# Rules: Synthesize Interview Snapshots

## Overview
This framework guides you through analyzing multiple interview snapshots to identify common patterns, integrate individual experience maps, and create comprehensive insights that reveal shared user needs and opportunities. It transforms individual data points into actionable patterns that inform product decisions.

## When to Use
- After completing multiple interviews on the same topic or user journey
- When you need to identify shared patterns across different user segments
- Before creating opportunities or generating solutions
- When sharing research findings with stakeholders
- When you have conflicting or unclear insights from individual interviews

## Output
**Format:** Markdown (`.md`)  
**Location:** `user-interviews/synthesis/`  
**Filename:** `synthesis-[initiative-name]-v[version].md`

**Semantic Naming Guidelines:**
- initiative-name: kebab-case initiative name from current initiative folder (e.g., live-sports-vod-conversion, newsletter-creation)
- version: auto-incrementing version number (v1, v2, v3...)
- Example: synthesis-live-sports-vod-conversion-v1.md

**Version Management:**
- Check existing files with same initiative pattern before creating new synthesis
- Auto-increment version number (v1 → v2 → v3...)
- Never overwrite existing synthesis files
- Preserve all synthesis versions for comparison
- No date dependency required

---

## Input Validation
**Prerequisites:** 
- [ ] Minimum 3-5 interview snapshots completed using [Create Interview Snapshots](./create-interview-snapshots.mdc)
- [ ] All snapshots follow consistent format and structure
- [ ] Snapshots cover similar topics or user journeys
- [ ] Quality check passed for all individual snapshots

**Data Quality Assessment:**
- **Completeness Score:** [X]/100 based on required sections
- **Behavioral Specificity:** [X]/100 based on concrete examples
- **Quote Quality:** [X]/100 based on representative statements

## AI Instructions for Synthesis

### When Receiving Multiple Snapshots
- **Validate Input Quality**: Check if snapshots meet minimum standards from create-interview-snapshots.mdc
- **Identify Research Gaps**: Note missing information that could strengthen synthesis
- **Request Additional Data**: Ask for missing snapshots if sample size is insufficient
- **Initiative Name**: Use current initiative folder name for semantic filename generation

### Incremental Synthesis Process (Efficiency Optimization)
- **Check for Existing Synthesis**: Look for previous synthesis files in the same initiative area
- **Identify New Snapshots**: Compare current snapshots with those already processed in existing synthesis
- **Process Only New Data**: If existing synthesis found, analyze only new snapshots and merge with existing patterns
- **Update Existing Synthesis**: Enhance previous synthesis with new insights rather than starting from scratch
- **Full Synthesis Only When**: No existing synthesis found, or significant topic shift detected

### Semantic File Naming Guidelines
- **Initiative Name**: Use current initiative folder name as primary identifier
- **Filename Format**: Use semantic naming pattern `synthesis-[initiative-name]-v[version].md`
- **Version Management**: Auto-increment version number based on existing files
- **Document Date Range**: Use actual interview date range (e.g., 2025-09-01 - 2025-09-07)
- **Folder Organization**: Store all synthesis files in initiative's synthesis folder
- **No Date Dependency**: Remove all date-based filename requirements

**Initiative Name Process:**
1. Use current initiative folder name as primary identifier
2. Ensure initiative name is kebab-case format (e.g., "live-sports-vod-conversion")
3. Use extracted topic instead of initiative name as primary identifier
4. Maintain consistency across all synthesis files for same initiative
5. No content analysis needed for topic extraction

**Version Management Process:**
1. Check existing files with pattern `synthesis-[initiative-name]-v*.md`
2. Find the highest version number for the same initiative
3. Auto-increment version number (v1 → v2 → v3...)
4. Generate new filename with incremented version
5. No manual version tracking required

**Initiative Name Usage:**
- **Folder-Based**: Use current initiative folder name directly
- **Consistency**: Use same initiative name across all synthesis versions
- **Kebab-Case Format**: Ensure initiative name is kebab-case (e.g., "live-sports-vod-conversion")
- **Uniqueness**: Each initiative has its own synthesis files
- **No Extraction**: No need to extract or analyze content for naming

### Pattern Recognition Guidelines
- **Focus on Behavioral Patterns**: Look for concrete actions, not opinions
- **Identify Emotional Journeys**: Map frustration, delight, confusion patterns
- **Document Workarounds**: Note how users currently solve problems
- **Preserve Context**: Maintain when/where/why details from individual stories

### Quality Standards
- **Evidence Strength**: Multiple participants supporting each pattern
- **Behavioral Specificity**: Concrete examples, not generalizations
- **Segment Clarity**: Clear understanding of user group differences
- **Actionable Insights**: Patterns that inform product decisions

- **Consistency**: Does it appear across different user types?

### 2. Intensity Analysis
- **Emotional Impact**: How strongly do users feel about this?
- **Urgency**: How critical is this problem?
- **Frustration Level**: How much does this bother users?

### 3. Context Analysis
- **When**: Under what circumstances does this occur?
- **Where**: In what environments or situations?
- **Why**: What triggers or causes this behavior?

---

## Key Principles

### 1. Preserve Individual Stories
- **Goal**: Find shared patterns while maintaining specific details
- **Approach**: Look for commonalities without losing individual insights
- **Practice**: Ask "What do these stories have in common?" and "How do they differ?"

### 2. Focus on Pattern Integration
- **Structure**: Organize around shared experiences and variations
- **Flow**: Show how patterns emerge across different users
- **Context**: Include thoughts, feelings, and pain points at each stage

### 3. Evidence-Based Synthesis
- **Support**: Every insight should have supporting quotes or observations
- **Frequency**: Note how often patterns appear
- **Variations**: Document differences between user segments

### 4. Actionable Outputs
- **Opportunities**: Specific problems worth solving
- **Insights**: Understanding that informs product decisions
- **Next Steps**: Clear actions for research and product teams

---

## Quality Indicators

### Strong Evidence
- **Multiple Sources**: Same insight from different users
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar behaviors across interviews
- **Specific Examples**: Concrete stories and quotes
- **Contextual Detail**: Rich understanding of when/why

### Weak Evidence
- **Single Source**: Only one user mentioned this
- **Vague Patterns**: General statements without specifics
- **Assumptions**: What you think vs. what users said
- **Over-Generalization**: Losing important details

---

## Error Handling

### Insufficient Data
- **Too Few Snapshots**: Request additional interviews before synthesis
- **Incomplete Snapshots**: Ask for missing information or re-interview
- **Poor Quality Data**: Suggest improvements to interview process

### Pattern Recognition Issues
- **No Clear Patterns**: Indicate need for more interviews or different approach
- **Conflicting Evidence**: Document contradictions and request clarification
- **Weak Evidence**: Highlight areas needing stronger support

### Quality Issues
- **Over-Generalization**: Push for specific behavioral examples
- **Missing Context**: Request additional details from original interviews
- **Unclear Variations**: Ask for better segment differentiation

### File Naming Issues
- **Initiative Name Mismatch**: Ensure initiative name matches the current initiative folder
- **Version Conflicts**: Always check existing files before creating new synthesis
- **Incorrect Format**: Use kebab-case for initiative name, v[number] for version
- **Missing Initiative Name**: Use the current initiative folder name for filename
- **Overwriting Prevention**: Never overwrite existing synthesis files, always increment version

---

## Common Synthesis Mistakes

### 1. Losing Individual Stories
- **Problem**: Over-generalizing to the point of losing specific insights
- **Solution**: Maintain balance between patterns and details
- **Practice**: Ask "What specific examples support this pattern?"

### 2. Ignoring Segment Differences
- **Problem**: Assuming all users follow the same journey
- **Solution**: Document variations by user segment
- **Practice**: Ask "How do different user types behave differently?"

### 3. Skipping Context
- **Problem**: Focusing only on actions without thoughts/feelings
- **Solution**: Include emotional and cognitive context at each stage
- **Practice**: Ask "What are users thinking and feeling at this stage?"

### 4. Confirmation Bias
- **Problem**: Only seeing what confirms your assumptions
- **Solution**: Actively look for contradictory evidence
- **Practice**: Ask "What would disprove this insight?"

### 5. Jumping to Solutions
- **Problem**: Moving too quickly from insights to solutions
- **Solution**: Stay in the problem space longer
- **Practice**: Ask "What else do we need to understand?"

### 6. Initiative Name Confusion
- **Problem**: Using vague or incorrect initiative names for filename
- **Solution**: Use current initiative folder name consistently
- **Practice**: Always check current initiative folder name before creating synthesis filename

---

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **INITIATIVE-BASED NAMING**: Use current initiative folder name consistently for file naming
- **EFFICIENCY FIRST**: Check for existing synthesis before starting new analysis
- **INCREMENTAL PROCESSING**: Process only new snapshots when updating existing synthesis
- Synthesize after multiple interviews on the same topic
- Focus on finding common patterns across individual stories
- Document variations by user segment
- Include supporting evidence for all insights
- Use the synthesis to identify opportunities
- Look for patterns, not just individual stories
- Document your synthesis process and reasoning
- Share findings with stakeholders for validation
- Use semantic naming: synthesis-[initiative-name]-v[version].md format
- Use initiative folder name for consistent identification
- Check existing files before creating new synthesis
- Auto-increment version number for same-initiative syntheses
- Preserve all synthesis versions for comparison
- **TRACK PROCESSED SNAPSHOTS**: Always note which snapshots were included in each synthesis
- **MERGE STRATEGICALLY**: Integrate new insights with existing patterns rather than starting over

### Don'ts
- Don't synthesize too early (before patterns emerge)
- Don't lose individual story details in generalization
- Don't ignore contradictory evidence
- Don't assume one user represents all users
- Don't skip the synthesis step to save time
- **NEVER**: Create synthesis filename without using initiative folder name
- Don't use vague or generic initiative names for filename
- Don't use inconsistent naming formats
- Don't overwrite existing synthesis files
- Don't skip version number checking
- Don't guess or assume initiative name without checking folder structure
- **AVOID**: Re-processing snapshots that were already analyzed in previous synthesis
- **DON'T**: Start from scratch when updating existing synthesis with new snapshots
- **AVOID**: Full re-synthesis unless significant topic shift or 5+ new snapshots
