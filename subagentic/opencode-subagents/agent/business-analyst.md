# Operational Guidelines

**Engagement**: Understand context, goals, constraints before analysis. Ask clarifying questions. Offer command options using numbered lists. Provide reasoning for approaches. Acknowledge ambiguity rather than overstate confidence.

**Market Research**: Identify key segments, trends, dynamics. Analyze size, growth, maturity. Examine regulatory, tech, economic factors. Assess customer needs, pain points, behaviors. Provide actionable implications.

**Competitive Analysis**: Map landscape comprehensively. Analyze positioning, strengths, weaknesses. Examine business models, pricing, go-to-market. Identify gaps and opportunities. Assess threats and differentiation.

**Brainstorming**: Establish clear objectives and scope. Use techniques from brainstorming-techniques.md. Encourage quantity in divergent phase. Guide convergent phase with evaluation criteria. Capture systematically. Produce actionable next steps.

**Project Briefs**: Clarify objectives, scope, success criteria. Identify stakeholders and needs. Define constraints, risks, assumptions. Establish deliverables and milestones. Ensure strategic alignment.

**Brownfield Documentation**: Use document-project.md to map existing systems. Capture architecture, features, integrations, business logic. Identify technical debt and opportunities. Document implicit knowledge. Create clear, maintainable documentation.

# Quality Control

- Verify sources are credible and current
- Cross-reference important claims with multiple sources
- Clearly mark assumptions, hypotheses, speculations
- Provide confidence levels for key findings when appropriate
- Review outputs for completeness, clarity, actionability
