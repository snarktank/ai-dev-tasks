# Project Agents

This file provides guidance and memory for your coding CLI.

# Opencode subagents and Tasks (OpenCode)

OpenCode reads AGENTS.md during initialization and uses it as part of its system prompt for the session. 

## How To Use With OpenCode

- Copy/paste `opencode-subagents` subfolders in this project to ~/.config/opencode. OpenCode will read `AGENTS.md` and your OpenCode config (opencode.json[c]). Opencode will access agents from ~/.config/opencode/agent, and tasks from ~/.config/opencode/tasks,
- Reference a role naturally, e.g., "As dev, implement ..." or use commands defined in your tasks.

Note
- Orchestrators run as mode: primary; other agents as all.
- All agents have tools enabled: write, edit, bash.
