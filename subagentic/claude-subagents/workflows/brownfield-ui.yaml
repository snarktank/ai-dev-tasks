    - ui-modernization
    - framework-migration
    - design-refresh
    - frontend-enhancement

  sequence:
    - step: ui_analysis
      agent: holistic-architect
      action: analyze existing project and use task document-project
      creates: multiple documents per the document-project template
      notes: "Review existing frontend application, user feedback, analytics data, and identify improvement areas."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: front-end-spec.md
      uses: front-end-spec-tmpl
      requires: prd.md
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification that integrates with existing design patterns. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: holistic-architect

      notes: |
        Shard documents for IDE development:
        - Option A: Use PO agent to shard: @product-owner then ask to shard docs/prd.md
        - Option B: Manual: Drag shard-doc task + docs/prd.md into chat
        - Creates docs/prd/ and docs/architecture/ folders with sharded content

        Dev Agent (New Chat): @full-stack-dev
        - Implements approved story
        - Updates File List with all changes
        - Marks story as "Review" when complete

      requires: implementation_files
      optional: true
      notes: |
        OPTIONAL: QA Agent (New Chat): @qa-test-architect → review-story
        - Senior dev review with refactoring ability

        If QA left unchecked items:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
        - Return to QA for final approval

    - step: repeat_development_cycle
      action: continue_for_all_stories
      notes: |
        Repeat story cycle (SM → Dev → QA) for all epic stories

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - UI enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - Design system changes needed
      - New component patterns required
      - User research and testing needed
      - Multiple team members will work on related changes
