# Rule: 1-Pager Creation Guide

## Goal

Guide the AI assistant to create **decision-focused 1-Pagers** in **narrative Markdown format** based on initial user input.  
The document should be readable within 5 minutes while providing sufficient context and discussion points to enable **fast, high-quality decision-making**.  

The core purpose is to validate whether Outcomes and Opportunities actually have enough value to be pursued as initiatives/projects. That is, rather than simply selecting solutions, we must examine: **"Are this opportunity and goal important enough to invest in and execute?"**

Rather than simple organization/sharing, we aim for **structures that deliberately trigger discussion**. In meetings, revealing disagreements and debating them leads to better decision-making than seeking consensus.  
Therefore, the key is to clearly show **"where disagreements might arise"** rather than "what we agreed on."  

## Guiding Principles

- **Clarity over persuasion:** Clarity over persuasion  
- **Structure over style:** Structured logic over fancy language  
- **Cognitive empathy:** Flow that can be understood through **quiet reading, not presentations**  
- **Truth-seeking:** Revealing uncomfortable facts without hiding them  
- **Initiative validation:** Verifying whether Outcome/Opportunity has justification to proceed as initiative/project

---

## Process

1. **Initial Input:** User briefly describes target users, problems, goals, service/product, and situation.  
2. **Clarifying Questions:** Before writing, essential questions must be asked to gather detailed information. (See Clarifying Questions below)  
3. **1-Pager Narrative Generation:** Based on input and answers, write **Outcome → Opportunity → Lessons → Solutions & Assumptions → Next Steps** elements as naturally connected paragraphs.  

After Clarifying Questions and 1-Pager draft creation, verify in 1-2 lines whether the validity of Outcome/Opportunity has been sufficiently reviewed. If insufficient, ask additional questions; if sufficient, proceed to next step.

---

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)
AI should adjust questions according to the prompt, but below are generally areas to explore.

- **Outcome:** "What specific results do you want to achieve?" "Is it a customer metric or business metric?"
- **Opportunity:** "What are the core pain points, needs, desires of customers that need to be solved?" "Why is this opportunity important compared to alternatives?" "If there's a customer story about this opportunity, what is it?"
- **Lessons Learned:** "Have you had similar attempts in the past? Are there success/failure cases?"
- **Solutions:** "What options are you considering? (including Do Nothing)"
- **Assumptions:** "What are the top 2-3 assumptions that must hold for success?"
- **Decision Request:** "What specific decision does leadership need to make after reading this document? (e.g., whether to projectize this opportunity)"

---

## 1-Pager Structure

The document connects the elements below as one narrative. **"Justification as an initiative"** for Outcome/Opportunity must be included.

1. **Outcome (Goal)** – Clearly present customer/business impact, reasons why this goal is sufficiently important
2. **Opportunity (Opportunity and Customer Problem Identification)** – Core pain points, needs, desires, limitations of alternatives, importance of this opportunity
3. **Lessons Learned (Past Attempts and Lessons)** – Related cases and lessons learned
4. **Solutions & Assumptions** – Minimum 3 options (including Do Nothing), pros/cons, top 3 key assumptions
5. **Next Steps** – Clear decision request to leadership: "Whether to actually pursue this Outcome/Opportunity as a project"

---

## Target Audience (Primary Readers)
Primary readers are **decision-makers (leadership)**. Therefore, the document should be:  

- Short and clear,  
- Verifiable whether Outcome/Opportunity itself has justification as an initiative,
- **Understandable context and discussion points from the document alone** without other materials or verbal explanations,  
- Written at a level where discussion can begin immediately.  

---

## Output
- **Format:** Markdown
- **Form:** Narrative paragraphs (Amazon-style narrative format)  

---

## Final Instructions
1. Don't generate the 1-Pager immediately; first supplement input through clarifying questions. Especially include questions that can verify the justification of Outcome/Opportunity.  
2. Write a narrative 1-Pager reflecting the user's answers.  
3. Verify that the completed document fulfills the purposes of **triggering discussion, revealing uncomfortable facts, and decision-making resolution**.
