# 📂 Team Structure

## Purpose

This folder stores **team structure-related documents (org charts, role definitions, operating models, etc.)**.
Cursor IDE's rules and workflows become more powerful when they understand **organizational context**,
so uploading team structure materials here enables **automated reviews, decision support, and strategic feedback**.

---

## Recommended Documents to Upload

* Company/team **org charts**
* Role definitions by team (PM, Designer, Engineer, Data, Research, etc.)
* Re-org plans and retrospective materials
* Team mission and principles definition documents

---

## How to Use This Folder

1. Upload organizational structure documents such as org-chart.png / org-structure.md here
2. When running Cursor rules, reference team-structure folder documents to provide **team responsibility/role-based feedback**
3. Store retrospective documents before and after re-org discussions for **historical context tracking**
4. When reviewing key documents (Product strategy, OKR), reference them together with related team structure documents

## Key Team Structure Design Models

### 1. Functional (Function-centered Organization)

* **Overview**: Organized by functions such as engineering, design, marketing, etc. Maximizes expertise and efficiency.
* **Examples**:
  * Starbucks: Department-based operations (HR/Finance/Marketing)
  * Apple: Function separation (Design/Hardware/Software)
* **Key Stakeholders**: Functional leaders
* **Core Metrics**: Functional efficiency, cost reduction (e.g., cost per lead)
* **Advantages**: Enhanced expertise, clear responsibilities
* **Disadvantages**: Silos formation, weakened customer focus, lack of business performance accountability

---

### 2. Matrix (Matrix Organization)

* **Overview**: Dual structure where employees report to both functional leaders and product leaders.
* **Examples**:
  * Philips Consumer Health: Cross-functional + product teams
  * Google: Functional organizations converging at product/project level
* **Key Stakeholders**: Functional leaders (primary), Product leaders (secondary)
* **Core Metrics**: Functional performance (primary), Product performance (secondary)
* **Advantages**: Enhanced cross-functional collaboration, maintained product focus
* **Disadvantages**: Priority conflicts between leaders, decision delays, duplicate work

---

### 3. Value Stream (Value Stream-centered Organization)

* **Overview**: Teams organized by customer journey/business outcomes, operating cross-functional autonomous teams.
* **Examples**:
  * Spotify: Squad/Chapter/Guild model
  * HubSpot: Product line-based operations (Marketing Hub, Content Hub, etc.)
* **Key Stakeholders**: Product/Cross-functional leaders (primary), Functional leaders (secondary)
* **Core Metrics**: Product performance (user engagement, conversion rates)
* **Advantages**: Increased execution speed, optimized collaboration, clear performance accountability
* **Disadvantages**: Team duplication, inconsistency risks, increased management complexity

---

### 4. Divisional (Division-centered Organization)

* **Overview**: Independent operations by product line/division. Each division holds P&L responsibility.
* **Examples**:
  * General Electric: Divisions (Aerospace, Power, Digital, etc.)
  * Amazon: Retail, AWS, Prime Video, Devices, etc.
* **Key Stakeholders**: Division leaders (GM, VP)
* **Core Metrics**: Division-level financial performance (Profit & Loss, ROI)
* **Advantages**: Enhanced market focus, maximized autonomy, clear performance accountability
* **Disadvantages**: Inter-division competition, customer experience fragmentation, increased management overhead

---

## Re-org Considerations

Re-org should only be executed carefully when there is a **strategy and organization misalignment**.
* **When needed**: When strategy has changed or current strategy and organization are misaligned
* **When to avoid**: Simply when a new leader joins, or for show-off restructuring

---

## Commonly Used Team Structure Patterns

* **Squad/Pod Model**: Small cross-functional teams responsible for specific problem spaces (Spotify model)
* **Triad**: PM-Designer-Tech Lead trio as core decision-making unit
* **Feature Teams**: Organized by product features
* **Outcome Teams**: Responsible for business metrics (e.g., retention, onboarding success rate)
* **Matrix Structure**: Dual reporting to functional and product leadership
* **Value Stream Teams**: Teams organized by customer journey or business flow (e.g., HubSpot, Spotify)
* **Divisional**: Separated by business units (e.g., Amazon, GE)

---

## **Team Structure Design Principles**

1. **Strategy and Structure Alignment**
   * Organization charts must reflect product strategy. (Structure must change when strategy changes)

2. **Clarification of Roles and Responsibilities**
   * R&R confusion prevention is essential, especially in Matrix or Hybrid structures.

3. **Balance of Speed and Consistency**
   * Decentralized (Squad/Pod) when fast execution is needed,
   * Centralized (Functional, Centralized) when user experience consistency is important.

4. **Importance of People and Culture**
   * Marty Cagan emphasizes that "good leaders, team skills, and culture are more important than structure"

**Tip:** Including not just "current structure" but also **why this structure was chosen (strategic context)** in organizational documents enables Cursor to provide more sophisticated feedback.
